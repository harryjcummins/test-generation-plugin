These are all of the prompts I used during my implementation of this plugin.

Claude:
"How can I edit my command prompt file so that when I call a plugin command Claude can recognise and read my currently selected code"
"Which hook types would be most effective for usage during unit test generation"
"What important events or scenarios must be dealt with when creating unit tests"
"How can I improve clarity and simplify my command prompt so that anyone is able to understand the process"
"Polish my skill.md formatting to produce the clearest and easiest to follow set of instructions"
